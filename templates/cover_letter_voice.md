The mind is a terrible thing to waste, and I have been fascinated by this amazing tool ever since I was a child. The work you do at the Canadian Mental Health Association to provide moorings for those whose very mental faculties are under siege – to shine a light in the dark by which they may return to themselves, is the kind of effort I would love to bring my skills to bear upon.
The mind is indeed a terrible thing to waste. This is why ever since I returned from my foray into 3D animation, during which I led VFX teams that delivered blockbuster movies such as Jordan Peele’s NOPE and Saving Bikini Bottom from the SpongeBob universe, the study of technology and the manipulation of it, has been my all-consuming passion. The simple summary here is: I love coding. It has enabled me to fully understand the computer as a bicycle for the mind- a lever by which human beings can accomplish previously impossible feats.
In my work with Orban Forest Inc, I lead a team using technology to solve business problems for small and medium scale businesses. My work is built around using technology to solve the visibility problem that the company’s customers face, and there I approach every problem with a researcher’s mindset. The work I do everyday involves building fast-loading, easy to navigate websites that look good on all devices. At this I am constantly deepening my capacity in preparation with a view to explore new frontiers of human-computer interaction and make technology more accessible to people.
Addressing the mental health crisis in Canada will require some of our best minds, but it also requires people with heart, who will not give up on those that falter in the dark. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills align with needs of the Canadian Mental Health Association.

Best regards,
